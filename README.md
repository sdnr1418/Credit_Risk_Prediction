# Credit Risk Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to **default on a loan** based on demographic and financial features.

This project uses **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** to model the likelihood of loan approval/default, with a focus on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison between classifiers

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Source:** [Loan Prediction Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)  

The dataset contains applicant demographic information, loan details, and the loan approval status.

**Key Columns:**
- `Gender` â€“ Applicant gender
- `Married` â€“ Marital status
- `Dependents` â€“ Number of dependents
- `Education` â€“ Education level
- `Self_Employed` â€“ Self-employment status
- `ApplicantIncome` â€“ Monthly income of applicant
- `CoapplicantIncome` â€“ Monthly income of co-applicant
- `LoanAmount` â€“ Loan amount in thousands
- `Loan_Amount_Term` â€“ Loan term in months
- `Credit_History` â€“ Credit history (1 = good, 0 = bad)
- `Loan_Status` â€“ Target variable (Y = approved, N = not approved)

## ðŸ‘‰ Steps Performed

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing values:
  - Categorical â†’ filled with **mode**
  - Numerical â†’ filled with **median**
- Checked for and confirmed **no missing values** after cleaning.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized:
  - Distribution of Loan Amount
  - Loan Status by Education Level
  - Applicant & Coapplicant Income distributions
  - Scatter plot: Income vs Loan Amount (colored by Loan Status)
- Generated correlation heatmap for numerical features

### **3. Model Training**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- ROC Curve & AUC score
